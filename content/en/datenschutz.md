Your data is important to me! That's why I created this web site with static individual pages that do not store any data from the visitor either on the server side nor on the visitor side (as cookies). Only the data technically necessary for communication is stored temporarily.

I do not use any third-party products on this website where I could not ensure that your data is handled responsibly. In particular, I refrain from using products from Google (Alpha) and Meta (Facebook), whose business model is aimed at marketing your data.

While this waiver is painful at times, I believe it is the only way to treat your data fairly. For this reason, I do not embed YouTube videos directly on my website. A click on the corresponding "fake player" pictures leads you directly to the pages of Youtube and shifts the data protection problem from me to Youtube... {{< icon "laugh" >}}

I incorporate the maps of the service "OpenStreetMap" ([https://www.openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org)), which are offered on the basis of the Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL) by the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF). [OSMF Privacy Policy](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy).

To the best of my knowledge, user data is used by OpenStreetMap solely for the purposes of displaying the map functions and caching the selected settings. This data may include, in particular, IP addresses and location data of users, which, however, are not collected without their consent (usually executed in the context of the settings of their mobile devices).
